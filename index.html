                    As this cartoon shows, feelings like a desire to eat hot dogs regularly trump discipline: the 98lb weakling of the human brain. Feelings are powerful messages sent by your brain and body to get you to act. For example, the fear you feel when you hear a menacing dog growl prepares you to react. Watch this fun video to learn more about feelings.

                    This “Discomfort food” cartoon helps show that tasty foods (sometimes known as comfort or junk foods) can be a powerful negative influence. But, here’s what most people don’t know:  food companies spend billions on food science and advertising to make sure their foods are irresistible. This process often “hijacks” your feelings in ways that keep you eating unhealthy foods and makes you fat and sick. RapidHealth helps you take back control so your feelings point you more often in healthy directions.

                    Like the man in the Stress Test cartoon, far too many people are slaves to unhealthy feelings like getting too angry. While people are born with the ability to shape their feelings, few people know how to do it efficiently. RapidHealth helps its users efficiently shape their feelings so they push them in healthier directions. Watch this fun video for a how-to introduction to shaping feelings.

                    <p>Unfortunately, the typical employee benefits website is not sufficiently clear and engaging. This is a missed opportunity and problem because, as Metlife’s 2014 survey reports, 53% of employees “need more help understanding how their benefits work and how they help meet their needs” (Metlife, p.5).  Of all the education and communications options for “selecting and enrolling in benefits”, employees picked a “benefits website” as the most helpful (Metlife, p.17).</p>
                    <p>Plus, employers typically organize the communications of benefits from the employer’s perspective, not from the employees’ perspective. If you scrutinize the sections in the Elder Care page above, you’ll see that we offer employees a single resource for successfully helping their aging loved ones – not just a summary of your elder care benefits.</p>

                    <p>Your employees are using their mobile phones like crazy. If you want to inspire them to better use their benefits, you must reach out to them through their mobile phones. But, you must also give them a great experience on their laptops and desktops. This poses a big challenge for your employee benefits website. Offering a website that works equally well on all screens sizes is time-consuming and expensive.</p>
                    <p>We have solved that problem. We can provide you a fully mobile, engaging employee benefits website for less than the cost of your creating one yourself. Plus, instead of you spending weeks creating it and then many days updating it, we’ll do all the hard work with direction from you. You get the credit.</p>

                    <p>You’ve spent a lot of time and money picking and providing employee benefits. Your primary goal is to attract, retain, and empower the strongest employees. But, as Metlife’s 2014 survey reports, 53% of employees “need more help understanding how their benefits work and how they help meet their needs” (Metlife, p.5).  The importance of employee benefits is growing:</p>

                      <li>43% of employees agree that “Benefits are an important reason why I came to work for my employer,” up from 28% in 2012 (Metlife, p.2).</li>

                    <p>RapidHealth will improve your employees’ biomarkers — blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and body fat. This will lower your spending on type 2 diabetes and heart conditions in two ways: prevent relatively healthy employees from becoming more expensive; and reducing the costs from already unhealthy employees. Averting Type 2 diabetes in one pre-diabetic employee will save you about $8,000 annually. Preventing one employee with high cholesterol from needing bypass surgery will save you about $40,000.</p>
                    <p>RapidHealth will relieve and prevent minor cases of anxiety and depression by getting more people physically active, improving their social health (particularly by fostering greater nurturing relationships), and enhancing their emotional health. If one employee avoids depression, you’ll save about $1,800 annually in direct medical costs and even more in increased productivity: about 85% of the cost of depression is the result of reduced productivity.</p>
                    <p>RapidHealth will prevent and relieve some musculoskeletal injuries, particularly back pain. It will help people use a mix of self-massage and corrective movements. If one employee avoids back surgery, you’ll save about $40,000 in medical costs plus many lost work days.</p>

                        When his dad died, Elliot was the EVP of a 300 employee, $30million/year IT services firm, where his responsibilities included strategy, leadership, marketing, managing all legal issues, and overseeing finance. He began that job in September 2004 and left it in September 2007 to concentrate full-time on building CollaborativeHealth – which led him to recruit our outstanding team.
                        Elliot is a member of the board of directors of the American Council on Exercise. Before his IT services position, Elliot practiced law with McElroy, Deutch, Mulvaney &amp; Carpenter in New Jersey. Prior to that, from 1995 to December 2002, Elliot served as an Assistant U.S Attorney for the District of N.J., where he was the Computer and Telecommunication Coordinator and prosecuted high-tech and IP criminals including David Smith for disseminating the Melissa Virus.
                        He received a B.A. from Yale in 1987 (where he played both football and lacrosse poorly) and a J.D. Summa Cum Laude from Seton Hall University School in 1992, where he was an Articles Editor for the Law Review. He is the former law clerk to the Honorable Morton I. Greenberg, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

                        He also produces F*ster-Cl*ck, a stand-up/variety show committed to showcasing new comedians without exploiting them for profit. His comedy has been described as "edgy" by his management company--but that's mostly because he doesn't shave every day. There is nothing particularly remarkable about his background from a health perspective, although he was on the track team in high school (go Eagles).

                        Jeff has been a member of his local gym for almost 3 years, and in that time has impressively gone there to work out almost 70 times. Jeff is uninsured and this upsets his mother. Jeff wants to lead a healthy lifestyle, but finds it much easier to be lazy and worry about his health later. Jeff acknowledges that this is pretty stupid.

                        Jeff is exactly the kind of person Collaborative Health is trying to reach and assist...which is why he's been hired as our Head Writer. He has a BA in Humanities from Wofford College in South Carolina, a small school you've never heard of, in a state you may have driven through. More than most things, Jeff loves making people laugh. More than anything, Jeff loves ice cream. He agreed to work for Collaborative Health because they promised him this was ok.

                        A Seattle native, Kim and her family now live in sunny Virginia Beach, Virginia, where she frequently jogs without getting wet at all. Before escaping the corporate world to stay home with her kids and draw cartoons, she worked for Boeing and learned first-hand the health benefits of sitting in a cubicle for eight hours a day.
                        As a mother, Kim has experienced the fun of teaching healthy eating and exercise to her daughters, both of whom now eat vegetables semi-voluntarily and occasionally unplug from social media long enough to do actual things. She has also demonstrated to them how it is easy to stop drinking soda by quitting approximately 200 times. Kim's equal love of exercise and cheesecake lead to many cartoons.
                        Kim holds a B.A. in Art, Graphic Design from Western Washington University. She was the 2000 recipient of the National Cartoonist Society's Gag Cartoon Award. Her cartoons have appeared in many publications and collections, including The Rejection Collection, Funny Ladies and the annual New Yorker Cartoons of the Year.

                        Dr. Pascual-Leone received his M.D. in 1984 and his Ph.D. in Neurophysiology in 1985, both from Albert-Ludwigs University in Freiburg, Germany. Following an internship in Medicine at Staedtisches Klinikum Karlsruhe in Germany and residency in Internal Medicine at Hospital Universitario de Valencia in Spain, Dr. Pascual-Leone completed a Neurology residency at the University of Minnesota, and then trained in Clinical Neurophysiology and Human Motor Control at the University of Minnesota and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He joined Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in 1997, after several years at the Cajal Institute of the Spanish Research Council.
                        The overarching goal of Pascual-Leone's research is understanding the mechanisms that control brain plasticity across the life span to be able to modify them for the patient's optimal behavioral outcome, prevent age-related cognitive decline, reduce the risk for dementia, and minimize the impact of developmental disorders such as autism.
                        Dr. Pascual-Leone is a world leader in research and development, clinical application, and teaching of noninvasive brain stimulation. Dr. Pascual-Leone's work has been fundamental in establishing noninvasive brain stimulation as a valuable tool in clinical and cognitive neurosciences, increasing knowledge about its mechanisms of action, critically improving the technology and its integration with several brain-imaging methodologies, and helping to create the field of therapeutic brain stimulation. In clinical trials, Dr. Pascual-Leone’s team has provided proof-of-principle evidence for the efficacy of noninvasive brain stimulation in treating various neurologic and psychiatric conditions, including epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, chronic pain, autism, and drug-resistant depression. Dr. Pascual-Leone has authored more than 500 scientific papers as well as several books, and is listed inventor in several patents. His work is highly regarded for its innovation and quality and is highly cited. Dr. Pascual-Leone ranks number 1 among authors worldwide in the specific field of "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation" and "Noninvasive Brain Stimulation" (http://www.authoratory.com/).
